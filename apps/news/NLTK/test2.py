It\'s a good feeling. I can read simple books and have non technical conversations.\nI suppose at least the tree is now planted, and I plan to go all the way to C2 with Chinese. However, looking back at how much work it took, if I knew then what I know now, I would probably just study an easier language like Spanish or French.\n  submitted by   /u/AegeanJimmy \n[link]   [comments] (Speak English, learning Spanish) Is it better to watch tv with Spanish audio & English subtitles, or have English audio & Spanish subtitles? \nPosted: 21 Jan 2017 10:10 AM PST\nIf should I do Spanish audio with no subtitles and just try to get a basic sense of what\'s going on?

How true is this that you naturally pick up the language after living somewhere else for a while? I\'d always imagined that it was full of frustration from both sides of people, and just wanted to know what it is really like?\n  submitted by   /u/guysitsme98 \n[link]   [comments] Esperanto myths \nPosted: 21 Jan 2017 10:24 AM PST\n  submitted by   /u/void1984 \n[link]   [comments] Here\'s a video I made in an effort to expose the benefits of bilingual preschools. \nPosted: 21 Jan 2017 09:46 AM PST\n  submitted by   /u/tack00 \n[link]   [comments] Arabic keyboard or Arabic PC? \nPosted: 21 Jan 2017 05:24 AM PST\nI\'m starting weekly Arabic classes this week, I\'m new to the language but I thought I\'d install a keyboard on my iPhone so I can try and get to grips with it technology-wise while taking the classes.

Instead of wasting my time with duolingo, with tourist-guide collections of sentences, with progressive textbooks etc. I would simply study a good grammar and memorize a huge list of words.\nOf course, I soon found out that reality didn\'t match my expectations. I still think that studying the whole grammar and memorizing a few thousands of words is the smart way of studying that part of a language that can be compressed this way, but once you\'ve done that you are still, at best, at B2, and you have still a long road before you, before you can really just enjoy the language and stop worrying about it.\nAnd worst of all, this "incompressible" part that remains is the most boring, less satisfying part. \nIn the first couple of months you learned the 3000 most common words, and felt like you were making big progress every day. Basically, after every single session of flashcard practice you could understand new things. -> Now, in order to really be able to comfortably read everything, you must learn 20000 more words, each one of which you will almost never meet.\nIn the first few months you learned the grammar of the language and the most important exceptions, going from not knowing anything about the language to be able to parse virtually every kind of sentence -> Now you must learn thousands of exceptions, idiom phrases, and shades of meaning for which there is no easy way, except keep practicing for years.\nPersonally, I\'m trying to cope with this fact using a simple strategy: I will still use the first months to study the compressible part in the smartest way possible, after which I will stop studying and just put the language on autopilot (for example by making sure that each month I read at least one new book in it). \nI was wondering how you guys face this challenge. Do you lose your enthusiasm when the compressible part is done and now you just have to put in a lot of time for invisible progress? Have you found good strategies for keeping your relationship with the language going even in this phase? \nOr maybe you have even found some way to make compressible some part of the language that looks incompressible?\n  submitted by   /u/rob0tcore \n[link]   [comments] Bulgarian verbs - help? \nPosted: 21 Jan 2017 01:15 AM PST\n\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0442\u0435 :) I am learning Bulgarian but I am finding it difficult to learn and recognise the different forms (tenses, person etc) of each verb.\nDoes anyone know if there is anywhere on the internet that has a list of all forms for each verb?

I bought a book called Modern Brazilian Portuguese Grammar A Practical guide by John Whitman, and a Portuguese dictionary. I\'m becoming fluent in Spanish, and of course I\'m fluent in English. I really learn accents from hearing them, and so far I\'ve kinda struggled to find any good videos of conversations of Brazilian Portuguese speakers or just people talking, including any YouTube channels. I\'ve began learning the consonants, and nasal sounds and I felt that it would be helpful to have someone to mimic. So if anyone has any good Brazilian Portuguese recommendations, I would really appreciate it. Also, if you guys know any good workbook type resources with problems, I would also appreciate that. Thanks!\nTldr; I would really appreciate a good source of people speaking Brazilian Portuguese. Also a workbook recommendation would be appreciated also. \xa1Gracias! \xa1Obrigado!\n  submitted by   /u/ry_alf \n[link]   [comments] You are subscribed to email updates from \u2cad\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca3\u2c89 | Languagelearning .\nTo stop receiving these emails, you may unsubscribe now .

Jones, a U.S. Men\u2019s National Team member, joins the Galaxy after spending seasons with the Colorado Rapids and the New England Revolution in MLS and recording an accomplished career in Germany. Jones was acquired through the use of Targeted Allocation Money (TAM). \n\u201cJermaine is a winner who has experience in MLS and playing against the highest competition in the world,\u201d said LA Galaxy Head Coach Curt Onalfo. \u201cHe has a relentless engine on the field and we are confident that he will strengthen our midfield. We look forward to him joining the Galaxy as we prepare for the upcoming season.\u201d \nJones, 35, spent the previous three seasons in Major League Soccer with Colorado and New England as he led his teams to the 2014 MLS Cup Final and the 2016 MLS Western Conference Finals, respectively. Prior to his time in Major League Soccer, Jones has a storied career in the German Bundesliga, where he played for nearly 15 seasons across Eintracht Frankfurt, Bayern Leverkusen and Schalke 04. The midfielder has also been a stalwart as a member of the U.S. Men\u2019s National Team, making over 60 appearances since 2010, including featuring in the 2010 FIFA World Cup. \nJones began his professional career as a member of Eintracht Frankfurt in Germany and went on to make nearly 50 appearances. The veteran then featured for Bayern Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt before making a move to Schalke 04, where he spent seven seasons with the club. During that time, Jones made more than 140 appearances and scored 10 goals. He then spent a brief stint with Be\u015fikta\u015f in Turkey before moving to MLS in 2014. \nJones joined the New England Revolution in August 2014 and played a crucial role in leading his team to the 2014 MLS Cup, where the Revolution fell 2-1 to the Galaxy at StubHub Center. After joining the Colorado Rapids in 2016, Jones helped Colorado reach the 2016 MLS Western Conference Final series where they fell to the eventual MLS champions Seattle Sounders. In total, he has made 37 appearances (32 starts) while scoring five goals and adding six assists. In matches which Jones appeared in, his teams have gone 21-5-11 during his MLS career. \nIn addition to his accomplished professional career, Jones became one of the USMNT\u2019s most reliable players since his first appearance in 2010. To date, Jones has made 67 appearances and scored four goals as a USMNT member, including a goal in the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Portugal. In addition to the 2014 FIFA World Cup, he represented the U.S. at the CONCACAF Gold Cup in 2011 and 2015 and the Copa America Centenario in 2016, among other competitions. \nJones and the Galaxy will kick off the 2017 Major League Soccer Regular Season on Saturday, March 4 at StubHub Center when they host 2016 MLS Supporters\u2019 Shield winners FC Dallas at 1 p.m. PT live on Univision.', 'title': u'LA Galaxy sign midfielder Jermaine Jones'}, 2: {'body': u'\xa9 2016 MLS.

He plays that holding midfielder position that is very hard to fill at the national team level, and while his play isn't spectacular, he avoids the precipitous valleys which plague so many USMNT defenders. (Maybe that's selective memory on my part.) I always like the effort he gives, and although he's on a Western Conference team (and thus battles for a playoff spot with my Timbers).
